# Lesson 3.3: Use Classes
# Mini-Project: Check Profanity

# Typos can be embarassing! Imagine how you'd feel if you
# accidentally sent your boss an email that said "I'll take
# a sh!t at it" instead of "I'll take a shot at it". Write
# a program that can detect curse words in a string of text.

# Use this space to describe your approach to the problem.
