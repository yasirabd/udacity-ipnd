# Lesson 2.7: How to Solve Problems - Days Between Dates

# In this lesson, you'll be working on solving a much
# bigger problem than those you've seen so far. If you
# want, you can use this starter code to write your
# quiz responses and then copy and paste into the
# Udacity quiz nodes.

# Simple Mechanical Algorithm
# days = 0
# while date1 is before date2:
#     date1 = advance to next day
#     days += 1

# Fill in the functions below to solve the problem.

def isLeapYear(year):
    return True

def daysInMonth(year, month):
    return 30

def nextDay(year, month, day):
    if day < daysInMonth(year, month):
        return year, month, day + 1

def dateIsBefore(year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2):
    if year1 < year2:
        return True

def daysBetweenDates(year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2):
    days = 0
    while dateIsBefore(year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2):
        days += 1
    return days

# Below is a testing script that will check if your code is doing
# what it is supposed to. Don't change it! The test will run
# when you execute the file.
# Bonus: Can you figure out how the test works?

                  ((2012,1,1,2012,3,1), 60),

                  ((2011,1,1,2012,8,8), 585 ),
                  ((1900,1,1,1999,12,31), 36523)]

    for (args, answer) in test_cases:
        result = daysBetweenDates(*args)
        if result != answer:
